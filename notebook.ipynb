    "\n",
    "* better understand the role and mechanisms behind PoS tagging;\n",

If you are using a Jupyter Notebook, make sure the interpreter points to the correct `python` executable.\n",

    "For example we use conda to manage our environments, and we do the following to create a new one and activate  it:\n",

    "Imagine you have a large corpus and a large number of queries of the form “_Give me all documents in which all of the words x, y and  z appear_”. One way to answer such queries efficiently is to index the documents in the corpus: for instance implement a function called `index()` for which `index(document, word)` returns non-zero if and only if word occurs in document at least once.\n",

    "The size of this matrix is number of documents × number of distinct words that appear in the corpus. Clearly, the smaller the matrix, the faster the queries are executed. Ideally, we would like to reduce the number of words while not losing the ability to answer queries. One way to do this is to eliminate morphological variability — for instance, map both “_goes_” and “_went_” to the same column “_go_”. This is called \"_lemmatization_\". Part-of-speech tagging can help lemmatization so as not to confuse similar surface forms with different roles (e.g. not confuse \"_can_\" as in \"_a can of beer_\" as opposed to \"_I can do it_\".).\n",

    "When performing PoS tagging using a unigram-based tagger, the larger context in which the words appear is ignored. Unigram taggers consider only one item of context, in isolation. This poses a significant limitation on any tagger in this class: the most that it can do is to assign the a priori most likely tag to a given token. In a sense, the tag of each word is decided before it is placed in a sentence.  Therefore, the word “_object_” would be assigned the same part of speech every time, regardless if it appears as “_the object_” (should be a noun) or as “_to object_” (should be a verb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "An n-gram tagger picks the tag that is most likely in the given context of size n. An instance of an n-gram tagger is the bigram tagger, which considers groups of two tokens when deciding on the parts-of-speech. For example, we would expect a bigram tagger to find the correct tags for the two occurrences of the word “_objec_t” in the following sentence (as opposed to a unigram tagger):\n",

    "You have probably found a surprising result on our sample sentence and very low accuracy for the bigram tagger, when run alone. If you run the trained bigram tagger on a sentence it has not seen during training (e.g. bigram.tag(raw_sents[1]), you will notice that a majority of words will be tagged as “None”. When the bigram tagger encounters a new word, it is unable to assign a tag. It will also be unable to tag the following word — even if it was seen during training — because it was never seen preceded by a “None” tag. From this point on, all the words up to the end of the sentence will be tagged as “None” for the same reason. This explains the low accuracy of the bigram tagger when run alone.\n",

    "The problem that arises when using n-grams is that once we pass to larger values of n, more data is needed for training, as the specificity of the context increases. In other words, there are many more possible bigrams than unigrams and thus the word/tag combinations that we need to consider when tagging are less likely to have appeared in the training set, as n increases. This is known as the sparse data problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP.\n",
